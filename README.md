# AML-Project-2
## Requirements for Project

Your Python script prints a summary of your exploration:

- How many features/attributes does the dataset have?
 
- What is the class distribution?
   - How many instances in class1, how many in class2, â€¦
   
   - Visual display of the instances (data points) with different classes colored differently
   
      - If you have more than 3 attributes in your dataset, you can plot the data points in reduced dimensions (2 or 3)
- Dataset partition (training, testing); how many percent of the data is used for training and how many percent for testing

- Confusion matrices:
   - kNN
   
   - logistic regression
   
   - SVM
