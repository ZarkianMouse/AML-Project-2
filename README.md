# AML-Project-2
## Requirements for Project

Your Python script prints a summary of your exploration:

 1. How many features/attributes does the dataset have?
 
 2. What is the class distribution?
  
  1. How many instances in class1, how many in class2, â€¦
  
  2. Visual display of the instances (data points) with different classes colored differently
  
    1. If you have more than 3 attributes in your dataset, you can plot the data points in reduced dimensions (2 or 3)
 
 3. Dataset partition (training, testing); how many percent of the data is used for training and how many percent for testing
 
 4. Confusion matrices:
 
   1. kNN
   
   2. logistic regression
   
   3. SVM
